# TurboPoly
Polynomial representations and polynomial arithmetic algorithms in Rust. 

## Traits
- [ ] Have traits for Ring or FFTUnity (I dunno, something that implements what's needed for FFT)

## Representations to try:
- [ ] Two vectors
- [ ] Coefficient lists
- [ ] DAGs
- [ ] Hash tables

## Algorithms to implement
- [ ] Naive Algorithm
- [ ] Wiedmann's Algorithm (https://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/profs/Francois.Morain/Master1/Crypto/projects/Wiedemann86.pdf)
- [ ] Method of Four Russians
- [ ] Fast Fourier Transform

## Testing Tools
- [ ] How to make random polynomials
  - [ ]  Homogeneous
  - [ ]  Bounded Coefficients
  - [ ]  Sparse
  - [ ]  Given degree

## Putting it all together
- [ ] How to test an algorithm with a certain representation and certain test sets
